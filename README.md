## Election Audit Summary

The following are outlines for expanding the use of the existing program for electiion analysis.  The first capability is to add another dictionary which is populated by user input.  This can be used to add candidates and counties not in the csv data file, or it could be used to create addional csv data files.  The second modification is to give the program the capability to append previous reports onto existing reports, with a report label.  In this way, previous reports could be viewed if the list of canidates/counties changes.

1. First proposed modification:  add a supplemental dictionary

2. Second proposed modification:  add capability to append previous reports
